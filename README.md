# correlation-heatmap-students-performance📈

## 📌 Project Overview
This task takes any dataset (like student scores, sales data, etc.) and visualizes relationships between variables using a correlation heatmap. A correlation heatmap shows how strongly pairs of variables relate to one another with colored cells representing correlation values. 


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
  -  python
  -  pandas
  -  numpy
  -  seaborn & matplotlib

## 📈 Key Analysis
  -  Load a dataset and select numeric features.
  -  Compute the correlation matrix to measure how variables move together (correlation ranges from -1 to +1).
  -  Plot a heatmap using Seaborn’s heatmap() to visualize these relationships with color intensities indicating strength and direction of correlations. 

## 📂 Dataset
Any structured dataset with numerical columns (e.g., student scores, sales figures, health metrics).

## 🎯 Goal
Understand and visually interpret relationships between variables, making it easier to spot strong positive or negative correlations and guiding further data analysis.
